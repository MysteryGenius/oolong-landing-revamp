        <p class="mt-4">
          In a world where one's value is often gauged by material success and
          social media likes, a
          <span class="font-bold underline">crisis of self-worth</span> is
          looming large. A diminished sense of self-worth can lead to a myriad
          of mental and emotional challenges.

        <p class="mt-4">
          By volunteering, one not only aids the community but also re-discovers
          their self-worth. The act of giving selflessly nurtures the soul,
          fosters empathy, and builds a foundation of positive self-regard.
